        <h2><b><u>Entity Objects</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            There are two primary entity objects identified using noun-extraction. The project will store information about ‘first generation’ Pokémon and any teams created by the user
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                Pokémon: the entity object that stores information about each Pokémon. It will allow Pokémon to be added to teams, to enable the user to easily see information about the Pokémon in one place, and to allow comparison between two Pokémon species. All attributes are set when entered into the database and immutable (unless changed at an administrative level inside the database).
                <p>Attributes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name (string): the name of the Pokémon</li><br>
                    <li>HP (integer): the base health statistic*</li><br>
                    <li>Attack (integer): the base attack statistic*</li><br>
                    <li>Defense (integer): the base defense statistic*</li><br>
                    <li>Special Attack (integer): the base strength of the Pokémon’s special attack*</li><br>
                    <li>Special Defense (integer): the base strength of the Pokémon’s special defense move*</li><br>

                    <li>Evolve Level (integer): the level at which the Pokémon evolves into a different Pokémon (the value is NULL if it does not have an evolve level)</li><br>
                    <li>Location(s) (string): the location or locations where the Pokémon can be found in the game</li><br>
                    <li>Type (string): the Pokémon type statistic (water, fire, grass, rock, etc.)</li><br>
                    <li>Effectiveness (array): an array of all the strengths and weaknesses of a particular Pokémon when fetched from the database.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    *Each Pokémon species has a base level of HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, and Speed regardless of the moves they have and level that they are.

            <li>
                Team: the entity object that stores information about a Pokémon team (of max 6 Pokémon to match the in-game team size) that has been created. It enables the user to retrieve teams that they have created and saved earlier and then to make changes to them. All attributes in the team entity project are set when the user saves the team that has been created.
                <p>Attributes:</p>

        <h2><b><u>Boundary Objects</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            Each boundary option has two sections to it. What details the information that the object must be input by the user and/or the information that will be presented to the user. How is a broad explanation on how the information will be presented and/or the action required from the user to obtain the information necessary.
        </p>

        <ol type="1">

                    <i>What:</i> The log-in menu will be used to record the user credentials and to identify the particular user. It will require two pieces of information from the user: the user ID and the password. If the credentials provided are not associated with a recorded user, an error message should pop up and ask for different credentials. Additionally, if the user forgets log-in password, the web page will direct the user to the help centre, where the user can reset the password through texts or emails.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>How:</i> The user will type in the information. The error message and help centre will be a separate window.
