    <h2><span id="1.0">(1.0) Introduction</span></h2>
    <h3><span id="1.1">(1.1) Purpose</span></h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to provide Pokémon players with a comprehensive database of relevant information which will allow them to make educated decisions on how they would like to play the game. Specifically, how they can optimize their Pokémon teams based on information our application provides. 
    </p>

    <h3><span id="1.2">(1.2) Scope</span></h3>
    <p>
        We aim to have all 151 Generation I Pokémon in our database, along with the following information which has already been provided by the ingame Pokédex: name, description, type(s), height, weight, brief biography description, and location. As well as additional information that is relevant but not provided in-game: abilities, catch rate, type match ups, leveling-rate, and EV yield. We would also like to have a user account system using a password hashing algorithm to store passwords. Users will be able to save information to their account.
    </p>

    <h3><span id="1.3">(1.3) Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations</span></h3>
	<u><b>Move</b></u>: A move, also known as an attack is the skill Pokémon primarily use in battle.
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Type</b></u>: Pokémon and the different moves they can use are all classified by properties called Types. A Pokémon can be associated with one or two types whereas a move can only be associated with one type. Moves that deal damage to other Pokémon can have more of an effect, a neutral level of effectiveness, less of an effect, or no effect at all, based on their type and the type of the Pokémon they are being used against. An example of an effective move would be a Pokémon using a Fire type move against a Grass type Pokémon. An example of a less effective move would be a Pokémon using a Fire type move against a Water type Pokémon. Finally, an example of a move which would have no effect at all would be a Ghost type move being used against a Normal type Pokémon.
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Abilities</b></u>: An Ability is a game mechanic that provides a passive effect in battle or in the overworld. Individual Pokémon may have only one Ability at a time. Not every Ability is entirely beneficial; some of them are hindering.
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Catch rate</b></u>: Each species of Pokémon has a catch rate that applies to all its members. When a Poké Ball is thrown at a wild Pokémon, the game uses that Pokémon's catch rate in a formula to determine the chances of catching that Pokémon. Higher catch rates mean that the Pokémon is easier to catch, up to a maximum of 255.
	<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Type matchup chart</b></u>: A type chart, also known as type matchup chart, shows which modifiers are applied to move types when attacking Pokémon of each type. 
	<br>
	<br>
    <u><b>EV yield</b></u>: When a Pokémon is defeated in battle, it will give effort values to the Pokémon that participated in the battle against it.

    <h3><span id="1.5">(1.5) Overview</span></h3>
    <p>
        The Pokédex Encyclopedia(“the project”, “the software”) is a third party database created for the access of information on Generation I Pokémon. The purpose of this application is to give Pokémon players access to a greater depth of information on Pokémon that is not provided by the in-game Pokédex. This encyclopedia will be a guide for players who aims for completion rather than the be all and end all. Vital information like base stats, in-game locations, type effectiveness, natures, and learnset is not provided by other online encyclopedias. The Pokédex Encyclopedia strives to provide this information to allow the players to make educated decisions on how they would like to play the game.
    </p>

    <h2><span id="2.0">(2.0) Overall description</span></h2>
    <h3><span id="2.1">(2.1) Product perspective</span></h3>
    <p>
        The Pokédex Encyclopedia is a desktop program that provides an easily accessible database for information on all Pokémon in generation I. This will allow users to make educated and informed decisions on how they would like to play the game.
    </p>

    <h3><span id="2.2">(2.2) Product Functions</span></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Look up specific Pokémon and return their stats, moves, type, etc.</li>
        <li>Side by side compare Pokémon stats with other Pokémon</li>
        <li>Calculate damage against other Pokémon</li>
        <li>List where specific Pokémon can be found in-game</li>
        <li>Have a user system where users can save information</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span id="2.3">(2.3) User Characteristics</span></h3>
    <p>
        The intended users of our product will be all users of all ages and of all technical experience that are interested in Pokémon
    </p>

    <h3><span id="2.4">(2.4) Constraints</span></h3>
    <p>
        There will be no cost constraints. The only constraints that we predict to encounter will be development constraints.These include time and possible reliability constraints depending on which apis or frameworks we utilize. Furthermore, team members will be expected to learn how to use the software or any additional knowledge that they may need to complete the tasks they are responsible for.

Tables used in comparison should have three columns--one to identify which attribute or statistic is in the row, one for the value for Pokemon 1, and the last for the value for Pokemon 2.

    <h4><span id="3.4.2">(3.4.2) Security</span></h4>
    <p>
        When storing user passwords we will implement a hashing algorithm to keep their passwords as secure as possible. We will keep a log of the when and where users logged in from to try and better identify any possible attacks on the website. We will use encapsulation whenever possible to try and keep the various methods and data stored as safe as possible. Some of the techniques wer plan on use are the following: 

        <ol type="a">
            <li>Utilize certain cryptographical techniques</li>
            <li>Keep specific log or history data sets</li>
            <li>Assign certain functions to different modules</li>
            <li>Restrict communications between some areas of the program;</li>
            <li>Check data integrity for critical variables.</li>

    <h4><span id="3.4.3">(3.4.3) Maintainability</span></h4>
        <p>
            This web-application should be easily updatable because all that you would need to update is the web-application files where the server is hosted and it will be seamlessly updated for all users once they refresh their web pages. In addition, code needing to be updated should be easy to update through good coding practices like documentation and modularity of the various methods and functions.
        </p>
    <h4><span id="3.4.4">(3.4.4) Portability</span></h4></h4>
    <p>
        From a portability perspective this web-application should be available on any device with no setup required. By nature it should be able to be viewed and used on any system with internet and access to a web browser.
