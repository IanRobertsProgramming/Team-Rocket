            <p> Each boundary option has two sections to it. What details the information that the object must be input

              the information will be presented and/or the action required from the user to obtain the information

              <ul>
                <p><u><i>What:</i></u> The log-in menu will be used to record the user credentials and to
                  identify the particular user. It will require two pieces of information from the user: the user ID and
                  the password. If the credentials provided are not associated with a recorded user, an error message
                  should pop up and ask for different credentials. Additionally, if the user forgets log-in password, the
                  web page will direct the user to the help centre, where the user can reset the password through texts or
                  emails. </p>
                <p><u><i>How:</i></u> The user will type in the information. The error message and help centre

                <p><u><i>What:</i></u> Presents the user with an option to register a new account. When a user
                  attempts to create an account that already exists (based on the email being used), an error message will
                  be displayed to indicate the registration failure. Another error message will be displayed if the
                  information provided does not satisfy the requirements (e.g. username minimum/maximum lengths, etc.).
                </p>
                <p><u><i>How:</i></u> The user will type in information. The error message(s) will pop up in a separate

                  the search option, saved Pokémon, saved teams, and comparisons.
                </p>
                <p><u><i>How:</i></u> The object should
                  have four buttons, corresponding to each of the above options, that the user can click. </p>

                Pokémon that matches the search will be presented to the user and the user will be prompted to view this
                Pokémon or search again. However, if the Pokémon is not found, the search will return none and prompt an
                error message - “There is no matching result”.
              </p>

              <ul>
              <p><u><i>What:</i></u> The user must input which two Pokémon will be compared and then the user
                is presented with statistics (Name, HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Evolve
                Level, Location(s), Type) from two Pokémon and their photos respectively. Should the user input two of
                the same Pokémon, they will receive a warning/error message stating that “The two Pokémon are the same,”
                and the program will only display one copy of the data.

                  up to three, that they have created. Users are not able to create more than three teams and if they try
                  to, an error message will pop up to inform them that three teams at maximum is the rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <u><i>How:</i></u> A list of the names of the teams, sorted alphabetically.

              <ul>
              <p><u><i>What:</i></u> Presents the user with the information on a team, including a team name
                and Pokémon in the team. The user can input Pokémon that they would like to place on the team in an
                empty slot or to replace a team member. However, each team is only allowed to input up to six Pokémon,
                any member who attempts to input more than 6 Pokémon will be prompted with an error message- “You’ve
                reached the maximum limit of Pokémon in a team, this Pokémon cannot be added.”
              </p>
              <p><u><i>How:</i></u> The user will be able to click on slots and choose from a list. The slots will be presented to the
