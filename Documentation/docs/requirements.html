              <h4><span id="1.1">1.1 Purpose</span></h4>
              <p> The purpose of this project is to provide Pokémon players with a comprehensive database of relevant
                information which will allow them to make educated decisions on how they would like to play the game.
                Specifically, how they can optimize their Pokémon teams based on information our application provides.
              </p>

            <div> <a id="1.2" class="anchor"></a>
              <h4><span>1.2 Scope</span></h4>
              <p> We aim to have all 151 Generation I Pokémon in our database, along with the following information
                which has already been provided by the ingame Pokédex: name, description, type(s), height, weight, brief
                biography description, and location. As well as additional information that is relevant but not provided
                in-game: abilities, catch rate, type match ups, leveling-rate, and EV yield. We would also like to have
                a user account system using a password hashing algorithm to store passwords. Users will be able to save
                information to their account. </p>

              <h4><span>1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations</span></h4>
              <p><u><b>Move</b></u>: A move, also known as an attack is the skill Pokémon primarily use in battle.</p>
              <p><u><b>Type</b></u>: Pokémon and the different moves they can use are all classified by properties
                called Types. A Pokémon can be associated with one or two types whereas a move can only be associated
                with one type. Moves that deal damage to other Pokémon can have more of an effect, a neutral level of
                effectiveness, less of an effect, or no effect at all, based on their type and the type of the Pokémon
                they are being used against. An example of an effective move would be a Pokémon using a Fire type move
                against a Grass type Pokémon. An example of a less effective move would be a Pokémon using a Fire type
                move against a Water type Pokémon. Finally, an example of a move which would have no effect at all would
                be a Ghost type move being used against a Normal type Pokémon. </p>
              <p><u><b>Abilities</b></u>: An Ability is a game mechanic that provides a passive effect in battle or in
                the overworld. Individual Pokémon may have only one Ability at a time. Not every Ability is entirely
                beneficial; some of them are hindering.</p>
              <p><u><b>Catch rate</b></u>: Each species of Pokémon has a catch rate that applies to all its members.
                When a Poké Ball is thrown at a wild Pokémon, the game uses that Pokémon's catch rate in a formula to
                determine the chances of catching that Pokémon. Higher catch rates mean that the Pokémon is easier to
                catch, up to a maximum of 255.</p>
              <p><u><b>Type matchup chart</b></u>: A type chart, also known as type matchup chart, shows which modifiers
                are applied to move types when attacking Pokémon of each type.</p>
              <p><u><b>EV yield</b></u>: When a Pokémon is defeated in battle, it will give effort values to the Pokémon
                that participated in the battle against it.</p>

              <p> The Pokémon Encyclopedia(“the project”, “the software”) is a third party database created for the
                access of information on Generation I Pokémon. The purpose of this application is to give Pokémon
                players access to a greater depth of information on Pokémon that is not provided by the in-game Pokédex.
                This encyclopedia will be a guide for players who aims for completion rather than the be all and end
                all. Vital information like base stats, in-game locations, type effectiveness, natures, and learnset is
                not provided by other online encyclopedias. The Pokémon Encyclopedia strives to provide this information
                to allow the players to make educated decisions on how they would like to play the game. </p>

                decisions on how they would like to play the game. </p>

              <p> There will be no cost constraints. The only constraints that we predict to encounter will be
                development constraints.These include time and possible reliability constraints depending on which apis
                or frameworks we utilize. Furthermore, team members will be expected to learn how to use the software or
                any additional knowledge that they may need to complete the tasks they are responsible for. </p>

                  <h4><span>3.4.2 Security</span></h4>
                  <p> When storing user passwords we will implement a hashing algorithm to keep their passwords as
                    secure as possible. We will keep a log of the when and where users logged in from to try and better
                    identify any possible attacks on the website. We will use encapsulation whenever possible to try and
                    keep the various methods and data stored as safe as possible. Some of the techniques wer plan on use
                    are the following: </p>

                  <ol type="a">

                    <li>Keep specific log or history data sets</li>
                    <li>Assign certain functions to different modules</li>
                    <li>Restrict communications between some areas of the program;</li>

                    web-application files where the server is hosted and it will be seamlessly updated for all users
                    once they refresh their web pages. In addition, code needing to be updated should be easy to update
                    through good coding practices like documentation and modularity of the various methods and
                    functions. </p>

                    setup required. By nature it should be able to be viewed and used on any system with internet and
